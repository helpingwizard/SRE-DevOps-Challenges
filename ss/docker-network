1. bridge
Bridge networks create a software-based bridge between your host and the container. Containers connected to the network can communicate with each other, but they’re isolated from those outside the network.

Each container in the network is assigned its own IP address. Because the network’s bridged to your host, containers are also able to communicate on your LAN and the internet. They will not appear as physical devices on your LAN, however.

2. host
Containers that use the host network mode share your host’s network stack without any isolation. They aren’t allocated their own IP addresses, and port binds will be published directly to your host’s network interface. This means a container process that listens on port 80 will bind to <your_host_ip>:80.

3. overlay
Overlay networks are distributed networks that span multiple Docker hosts. The network allows all the containers running on any of the hosts to communicate with each other without requiring OS-level routing support.

Overlay networks implement the networking for Docker Swarm clusters, but you can also use them when you’re running two separate instances of Docker Engine with containers that must directly contact each other. This allows you to build your own Swarm-like environments.
